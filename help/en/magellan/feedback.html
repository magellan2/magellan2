    <h1>Feedback and Support</h1>

    <h2>Bugs in Magellan</h2>

    <p>
        For us as developers the error messages are a good start when tackling a problem. These can
        be found in the
        <tt>errors.txt</tt>
        file in the Magellan folder; please include these error messages if you have a problem with
        Magellan. To reproduce an error it may prove necessary to send in (an excerpt of) the used
        CR. These CRs are of course handled confidentially, and will be deleted after the issue has
        been resolved.
    </p>

    <h3>Feature wishes = further development</h3>

    <p>We try to develop Magellan according to the wishes of its users. Our bug tracker helps
        enormously in this, because all feature wishes are centrally and publicly available.</p>
