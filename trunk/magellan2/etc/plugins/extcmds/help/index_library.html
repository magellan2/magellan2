  <b>This is the editor environment of Extended Commands.</b>
  </p>
   <p>
This text attempts to clarify the complex possibilities of this
plugin. This editor is based on BeanShell and therefore similar to
Java. There are classes and methods. The variables are more tipical.
   </p>
   <p>
At the moment these work on the libraries for units and containers.
The following global variables are available:
</p>
<ul>
<li><tt>world</tt> - the most recently loaded report and all information connected
with it (islands, regions, factions, etc.)</li>
<li><tt>helper</tt> an auxiliary class with handy functions</li>
</ul>
<p>
To be able to use additional classes from Java or Magellan, these have
to be imported. This happens for example as follows:
</p>
<pre>
import magellan.library.*;

int getHorses(Region region) {
  return region.getHorses();
}
</pre>
<p>
The API for the individual classes is extensive. In principle one has
control over all facets of Magellan and the most recently loaded
report. In theory it is even possible to open custom windows, but this
documentation will not go into that. For a deeper understanding of the
API we recommend the following sites:
<ul>
<li>Magellan 2 API<br/>
<a href="http://magellan.log-out.net/javadoc/overview-frame.html">http://magellan.log-out.net/javadoc</a><br/>
Documentation on all classes and possibilities of the Magellan client.
The classes in magellan.library should prove especially interesting.
</li>
<li>Java 5 API<br/>
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/overview-frame.html">http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api</a><br/>
Documentation on the current Java environment. All these classes are
at your disposal.
</li>
<li>BeanShell Syntax<br/>
<a href="http://www.beanshell.org/manual/contents.html">http://www.beanshell.org/manual/contents.html</a><br/>
Complete documentation on the possibilities of BeanShell.
</li>
</ul>

More documentation to come...
