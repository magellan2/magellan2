                         Commons Email Package
                              Version 1.1
                             Release Notes

INTRODUCTION:
-------------

Commons Email aims to provide a API for sending email. It builds on the JavaMail
API with the aim of presenting a simplified API which is easy for developers who
are not mail experts to use. It is a compact component with a small number of
classes.

The Commons Email website is the source for the most recent information,
downloads, reports, and bug status:

http://commons.apache.org/email/

This is a maintenance release which fixes several bugs present in the 1.0
release and adds a number of small enhancements requested by
users. All current users are encouraged to upgrade.

CHANGES FROM 1.0:
-----------------

== Compatibility ==

* Java 1.4 or later is now required. Earlier versions are no longer
  supported by Sun.

* JavaMail 1.4 or later and JavaBeans Activation Framework 1.1 or later are now
  required.

* The protected field org.apache.commons.mail.HtmlEmail.inlineImages
  is now deprecated. Its function is now performed by the
  org.apache.commons.mail.HtmlEmail.inlineEmbeds field; the new field
  is a Map instead of a List. The change was made as part of EMAIL-50.
  Clients that have subclassed HtmlEmail should change their
  implementations accordingly.

== Notable bugfixes ==

* EMAIL-50: HtmlEmails were not being constructed correctly; several
  email clients were not displaying attachments or embedded images
  properly. As part of the same problem, duplicate embeds were not
  being handled correctly.

* EMAIL-1: Email.setContent() was not taking a specified charset into
  account. Additional setContent() overloadings were also added to
  address common use cases.

== Notable enhancements ==

* EMAIL-35: HtmlEmail now supports the embedding of any DataSource
  implementation. Specific methods were added for File and URL
  objects, removing the need for clumsy circumlocution.

* Character set handling and encoding has been overhauled to use the
  JDK 1.4 character set support. All charsets supported by the Java VM
  are now recognized and handled appropriately in Email.setCharset()
  and Email.setContent() calls.

* HtmlEmail performance has been slightly improved.

* The MIME structure of MultiPartEmail and HtmlEmail has been improved.

REQUIREMENTS:

J2SE environments
-----------------

Commons Email requires JavaMail 1.4 or later. The proprietary Sun implementation
is available at:

http://java.sun.com/products/javamail/  

However, the Apache Geronimo project (http://geronimo.apache.org)
provides a J2EE-certified implementation of the JavaMail 1.4
specification licensed under the Apache Software License.  

Commons Email also requires the JavaBeans Activation Framework. The
proprietary Sun implementation is available at:

http://java.sun.com/products/javabeans/glasgow/jaf.html

Apache Geronimo likewise provides an implementation under the Apache
Software License.

Commons Email has been tested with JDK 1.4.2_15 and JDK 1.5.0_12.

J2EE environments
-----------------

Commons Email is compatible with all certified Java Enterprise Edition
5 implementations; no further dependencies are required. 

Java 2 Enterprise Edition 1.4 users must ensure that the versions of
JavaMail and JAF indicated above are available to their applications;
the J2EE 1.4 specification only requires earlier versions.

Earlier versions of J2EE are not supported.
