    </p>

    <p>In this list Magellan shows all problems it has recognized. This
      list can be used as a starting point for orders still to be edited.
      Please note that Magellan is not able to find and report all problems
      that may occur. Nevertheless, this is a powerful tool that makes other
      tools like ECheck redundant.</p>
    <p>You can sort the problems by clicking on column headings. If you
      press control and then click on a different heading, you can sort by
      multiple columns.</p>
    <p>There are further option for configuring shown problems at the
      bottom:
    <ul>
      <li><b>S</b> Show only problems from regions that are marked in the
        map. If there are no marked regions, this has no effect.</li>
      <li><b>R</b> Show only problems of the currently active region.</li>
      <li><b>G</b> Additionaly show global problems, which do not belong
        to a particular region.</li>
      <li><b>Refresh</b> It can occasionally happen that problems are not
        calculated completely. You can re-start the calculation with this
        button.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>By double-clicking a line you can jump to the affected unit or
      region if applicable.</p>
    <p>You can configure the problems further with the context menu (right
      click on a line):</p>

    <ul>
      <li><b>Show full text</b> (also by pressing CTRL and double clicking
        on a line): Shows the full text, which may not always fit into the
        table column.</li>
      <li><b>Select object</b> Same as double click</li>
      <li><b>Refresh</b> Same as the button</li>
      <li><b>Suppress problem</b> This will hide this concrete problem for
        the report. This usually adds a special comment to the affected unit.</li>
      <li><b>Show hidden problems</b> Shows all hidden problems again and
        removes the added comments</li>
      <li><b>Permanently ignore similar problems</b> This suppresses all
        problems of a certain type also in future reports. This enables you to
        hide certain problems and concentrate on the important ones. For
        example, you may hide all warnings of empty buildings.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There are two major types of problems:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Report messages, for example messages about buildings that have
        not been paid</li>
      <li>Messages created by Magellan, for example warnings of missing
        maintenance silver</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can view suppressed problem types in the option section for the
      Open Problems. You can also re-enable suppressed problem types there.</p>
