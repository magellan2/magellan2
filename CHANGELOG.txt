2007-09-23  Thoralf (thoralf@m84.de)
    * Bug 68. Maybe this helps... (do not bring the startwindow to the front, only toBack())
      Actually this bug cannot be resolved at all, because the dialogs are children of
      the Client-Frame and the Startwindow isn't a child of Client. So a simple click
      somewhere on the screen destroys the generated layers (startwindow on top, Client behind
      it).

      that returns UTF8 instead of UTF-8 from the BOM)
    * Merging two reports with different encodings uses now UTF-8 or the encoding
      of the newer file (if no file uses UTF-8). If both reports use the same
      encoding the resulting report uses this encoding too.

2007-09-01 Fiete (sf@fietefietz.de)
