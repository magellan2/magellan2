/**
 * A comparator imposing an ordering on objects implementing the Sorted interface by comparing their
 * sorting indices.
 * <p>
 * Note: this comparator can impose orderings that are inconsistent with equals.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In order to overcome the inconsistency with equals this comparator allows the introduction of a
 * sub-comparator which is applied in cases of equality. I.e. if the two compared objects have the
 * same sorting index and they would be regarded as equal by this comparator, instead of 0 the
 * result of the sub-comparator's comparison is returned.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note 2: If the subcomparator is not consistent with this comparator, this can lead to wrong
 * results! For example, if this comparator returns <code>compare(o2, o3) &lt; 0</code> and is undefined on other
 * both (o1, o3) and (o1, o2), and the subcomparator returns <code>compare(o1, o2) &lt; 0</code> and
 * <code>compare(o3, o1) &lt; 0</code>, then it is impossible to predict if a sorting algorithm might return the
 * ordering (o1, o2, o3) or (o3, o1, o2), or (o2, o3, o1).
 * </p>
