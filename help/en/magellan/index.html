  <h1>Magellan Help</h1>

  <p>Magellan is a complete client for Eressea. You can view your map,
    search, give orders, and you almost only need to leave the program to send
    mails to your allies. Almost...</p>
  <p>This documentation is built up around the following chapters:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="menus/index.html">The menus</a>
    <li><a href="docks/index.html">The docks</a>
    <li><a href="reference/index.html">Reference</a>
    <li><a href="faq.html">FAQ</a>
    <li><a href="feedback.html">Feedback and Support</a>
  </ul>

  <p>
    In the JavaHelp version there are some additional tables and descriptions
    of the orders from the Eressea manual. These may, however, not be complete
    or completely up-to-date. When in doubt use the official rules at <a
      href="https://wiki.eressea.de/index.php/Regeln">https://wiki.eressea.de</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Unfortunately this documentation is incomplete. Several parts are missing
    or have to be expanded on. It may also happen that this documentation is
    not completely up-to-date, since Magellan is under constant development. If
    you miss anything, leave us a note at the <a href="feedback.html#bugs">Magellan
      bug tracker</a>. Of course any kind of help is welcome. The most important
    resource for recent information is our Website: <br /> <a
      href="https://magellan2.github.io">https://magellan2.github.io</a>
  </p>

  <h3>Thank you</h3>

  <p>to Stefan Götz and all other Magellan-developers for a very cool
    Eressa-client and the support for this online help and to Matthias Müller,
    who helped me with texts and tests.</p>
