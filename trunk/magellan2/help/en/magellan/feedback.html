<h1>Feedback and Support</h1>

<h2>Bugs in Magellan</h2>

<p>For us as Developers the error messages are a good start when
tackling a problem. These can be found in the errors.txt file in
the Magellan folder; please include these error messages if you
have a problem with Magellan. To reproduce an error it may prove
necessary to send in (an excerpt of) the used CR. These CRs are of
course handled confidentially, and will be deleted after the issue
has been resolved.</p>

<h2>Mantis</h2>

<p>Mantis (<a href=
"http://magellan-client.sourceforge.net/mantis/">http://magellan-client.sf.net/mantis/</a>)
is a Webplatform for bugreports and featurewishes, that for these
aspects is preferred over the mailing list, because it
significantly simplifies the handling of reports. For use it is
necessary to register, to be able to keep the reporter up-to-date
on the bugreport or feature wish.</p>

<br>
 

<h3>Featurewishes = further development</h3>

<p>We try to develop Magellan according to the wishes of its users.
Mantis helps enermously in this, because all feature wishes are
centrally and publicly available. Additionally Mantis offers
'Votings', which means that every user can vote whether or not a
certain new feature should be implemented. This makes it easy to
recognize which wishes are important and should get a high
priority.</p>

<a name="mailinglist"></a> 

<h2>Mailing list</h2>

<p>There is a mailing list for Magellan, <a href=
"mailto:eressea-javaclient@eressea.kn-bremen.de">eressea-javaclient@eressea.kn-bremen.de</a>,
where all changes to Magellan are announced. After such CVS-mails
Magellan is updated within minutes, so that you can download the
new version. Through the mailing list anyone that is interested can
join in the discussion about the program, ask questions about its
use or request help with problems.</p>

<p>If you send a mail to the list without being subscribed to it
you should mention this, because otherwise the answer will most
likely just be sent to the list again, and not to the sender.</p>

<p>To subscribe to the list it is enough to send a mail to <a href=
"mailto:majordomo@eressea.kn-bremen.de?body=subscribe eressea-javaclient%0Aend">
majordomo@eressea.kn-bremen.de</a> with an arbitrary subject
and</p>

<pre>
subscribe eressea-javaclient
end
</pre>

in the mail body.<br>
<br>
 

<h2>Newsgroup</h2>

<p>Through newsgroup <a href="news://eressea.upb.de/">Eressea
News-Server</a> (news://eressea.upb.de) you can post to and check
the mailing list without actually being a member. For access to the
newsserver you need the following information:<br>
Username: Faction number<br>
Password: Faction password</p>

<h2>IRC-Channel</h2>

<p>On IRC-Net in channel #magellan you can often find developers
and users. If not, you can always take comfort in our channelbot
Magrathea. Especially at night the usual suspects are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Thulai: Sebastian Tusk, Developer</li>

<li>NoOneElse: Stefan G&ouml;tz, Developer</li>

<li>LordBones: Sebastian Pappert, Developer</li>

<li>Toran: Ulrich K&uuml;ster, Developer</li>

<li>Nugman: Roland Behme, Documenter</li>

<li>SirRollo: Matthias M&uuml;ller, Documenter</li>
