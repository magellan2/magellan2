<h1>Magellan Help</h1>

<p>Magellan is a complete client for Eressea. You can view your map, search, give orders, and you almost only need to leave the program to send mails to your allies. Almost...</p>
<p>This documentation is built up around the following chapters:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="menus/index.html">The menus</a>
	<li><a href="docks/index.html">The docks</a>
	<li><a href="reference/index.html">Reference</a>
	<li><a href="faq.html">FAQ</a>
	<li><a href="feedback.html">Feedback and Support</a>
</ul>

<p>In the JavaHelp-version there are some additional tables and descriptions of the orders from the Eressea-manual. These may however not be complete or completely up-to-date. When in doubt use the official rules at <a href="http://www.eressea.de/rules/">http://www.eressea.de/rules/</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately this documentation is incomplete. Several parts are missing or have to be expanded on. It may also happen that this documentation is not completely up-to-date, since Magellan is under constant development. If you miss anything, please send a mail to our <a href="feedback.html#mailinglist">mailing list</a>. Of course any kind of help is welcome. Please give suggestions for improvement and corrections 
at the <a href="feedback.html#mantis">Bug tracker</a>. The most important resource for recent
information is our Website:
<br /><b><a href="http://magellan-client.sourceforge.net/">http://magellan-client.sourceforge.net/</a><b>
</p>

<h3>Thank you</h3>

<p>to Stefan Götz and all other Magellan-developers for a very cool Eressa-client and the support for this online help and to Matthias Müller, who helped me with texts and tests.</p>
