Getting started:

1) Build the jar file

  If you have the source distribution you will need to build the jar file
  using Maven.  For instructions on downloading and installing Maven see
  http://maven.apache.org/.

  To build execute the command 'maven'.  The jar file will be built in the
  target directory.

2) Generate the documentation

  Run the 'maven site:generate' command.  The documentation will be written
  to the target/docs directory.  The documentation has some examples of
  how to use this package as well as a FAQ.

3) Use

  Simply include the jar file built in step #1 in your classpath.  Import the
  classes that you want to use and you are ready to go!
