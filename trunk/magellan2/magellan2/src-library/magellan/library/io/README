How to read or write a file
-------------------------------------------------------------------
a) A file is selected by the user. Valid endings shall be: 
  - .cr , .cr.bz , .cr.gz     These annotate cr files
  - .xml, .xml.bz, .xml.gz    These annotate xml files
  - .zip                      These annotate zip files
b) If it is a zip archive, we have to look inside the file to choose 
   an appropriate file. Valid endings inside shall be
  - .cr   These annotate cr files
  - .xml   These annotate xml files
  If there are more than one file, a given interface may be asked for 
  a selection of one of these files.
With this information we are able to create a kind of FileType for reading and writing files.


How to read a file
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Presumptions: 
- a valid FileType is given

A GameDataReader now has to determine some things:
- check if it is a cr or xml file (perhaps we should keep this information in FileType?)
- read the game name out of the file to determine the game specific loader
- Read the rules of the game
- delegate the reading of the gamedata to the gamespecific reader (or to a generic reader if 
  no special reader found). 


How to write a file
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Presumptions: 
- a valid FileType is given
- a valid GameData object is given

A GameDataWriter now has to do the following steps
- delegate writing of the gamedata to the gamespecific writer
